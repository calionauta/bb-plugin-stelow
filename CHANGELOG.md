# Changelog

All notable changes to `bb-plugin-stelow`.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to a single-version-per-release tag format
(`vX.Y.Z`) on the `master` branch.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Full bb composer on the board.** The new-card form now uses bb's own
  `NewThreadComposer` (tiptap editor): type `@` for mentions, use the `+`
  action menu to attach files, skills, automations, or a plugin reference,
  and pick project/provider/model right in the form. Attached files are
  copied to the thread storage and listed as `Attached files:` in the card
  prompt — same behavior as bb threads.
- **Bundled Stelow skills.** The plugin ships the 27 `stelow-*` skills in
  `skills/` and declares them via `bb.skills`, so a fresh install no longer
  depends on `~/.claude/skills/stelow-*` symlinks or the
  `calionauta/stelow` repo being checked out. The agent prompt now reads the
  stage guides from the plugin's own skills directory.
- **Workspace-file mention provider** (`@` + filename resolves to
  `Workspace file: <path>` when the route has a project context).
- **Timed-out questions are answerable later.** If a `bb stelow ask` times
  out (user away), the question is persisted and the card shows
  "Question timed out" with the original options still clickable. Answering
  records it as a card comment and delivers the late answer to the worker
  thread, which the agent picks up on its next turn.

### Changed

- **Agent guidance on ask timeouts.** The worker prompt now tells the agent:
  on timeout, proceed with best judgment; re-ask at most once if still
  blocking; late answers arrive as comments.
- **Ask timeout is configurable** via `STELOW_ASK_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 1h)
  for testing and tuning.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **Cards now start in Triage instead of Running.** `createCard` wrote
  `status: "in-progress"` from the first INSERT, so a new card landed in the
  Running column and never passed through shaping. It now seeds
  `status: "draft"`, and `syncThreadState` promotes the card to
  `awaiting-answer` when a structured question is pending (listing it under
  "Gate pending") and to `in-progress` when the agent resumes real work.
- **Question form not rendering.** The worker prompt only said "call
  `bb.ui.requestInput`" without being categorical. The prompt now states the
  rule verbatim: any time the agent needs input it MUST call `bb stelow ask`
  (the structured form wired to `stelow-question`), never just write text like
  "waiting for your choice". The card flips to Gate pending automatically while
  the form is pending.
- **Realtime reloads now debounce** (`useDebouncedRealtime`, 250 ms) so bursts
  of mutations stop stampeding the board/card-detail RPC loaders.

### Changed

- **Repair uses a confirmation Dialog** instead of the fragile timed
  double-click (`setTimeout` + `confirmingRepair`). The dialog explains that
  state.md and stelow.json are reseeded and the worker restarts from triage.
- **Archive requires a destructive confirmation Dialog** instead of silently
  cancelling the card.
- **Filter UI collapses to a single "Filters" popover** with an active-count
  badge and a Reset button; the "Needs attention" toggle stays inline.
- **Keyboard and focus:** board cards are keyboard-operable (Enter/Space opens
  the card, `W` opens the worker thread), column containers expose `role=list`
  / `role=listitem` for the focus chain, and focus returns to the card detail's
  close button on a host-initiated detail restart.

### Added

- **Sidebar accessory badge:** the Stelow menu row shows a live count of cards
  in Triage/Shaping/Running/Gate pending, tinted as a primary badge when live
  (same pattern the Tasks plugin uses).
- **Defensive "awaiting answer" banner:** the card detail renders an amber
  banner with a path to the pending question when `activity` is
  `awaiting-answer`, so the form is never unreachable.
- **Agent presets** (schema mirrors the bb Tasks plugin):
  - New `presets` table: provider, model, reasoning level, permission mode,
    environment kind, base branch, machine, instructions, plus built-in and
    default flags. A read-only built-in `Default` preset ships and is used when
    a card has no explicit preset.
  - New `card_presets` join table; `createCard` and `reseedCard` persist the
    assignment and carry the preset's provider/model/reasoning/permission into
    the worker thread spawn (`executionInputSources: "explicit"`).
  - `reseedCard` now also stops the previous worker thread and spawns a fresh
    thread with the chosen preset, so swapping a preset and clicking Repair
    cleanly transfers the model + context.
  - New RPCs: `listPresets`, `upsertPreset`, `deletePreset`, `assignPreset`.
  - New CLI: `bb stelow preset list|add|remove|assign`.
  - Card detail surfaces a preset dropdown.

### Internal

- Added `awaiting-answer` to the `statusSchema` enum used by board/card types.
- Server/`app` compile clean at SDK `0.4.8` / bb `0.39.0`; `dist/data` and
  `dist/references` are copied by `postbuild.mjs`.
- Reconciled `package.json` version to `0.1.4` to match the published tag.
